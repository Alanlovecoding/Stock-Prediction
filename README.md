# Stock-Prediction
Used python to crawl the forum of Eastmoney.com(a Chinese finance website) and got people’s comments about a stock(e.g. CRRC 601766) and stored the data in a database using mysql. 

Wrote a program to make a sentiment classification on the comments using nltk module in pythin and generate a score which shows a person’s expectation of a stock.

Used the score and the stock index in the following days to choose people of a really good prediction rate and follow the those people’ s comments to make advice on the investment strategy.
